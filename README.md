## Check-Ins Plan

- Weekly check-ins will be scheduled every Monday to review progress and address any blockers.
- Daily stand-ups will be held each morning to discuss immediate tasks and updates.

## Project Organization and Workflow

- We will use [Trello](https://trello.com) to manage our project tasks and workflow.
- The project will be organized into the following phases: Planning, Development, Testing, and Review.
- Each phase will have specific deliverables and deadlines to ensure timely progress.

## Approaches Discussed

- We considered using a Kanban board versus a Scrum-based approach. 
- After discussion, we chose the Kanban approach due to its flexibility and ease of managing tasks in a continuous flow.

## Code Design Approach

- The code design will focus on modularity and separation of concerns, ensuring that each module or component has a single responsibility.
- We will use consistent naming conventions and adhere to design patterns to maintain code clarity and manageability.
